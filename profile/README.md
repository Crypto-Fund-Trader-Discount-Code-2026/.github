## 🚀 What is CNC Tattoo?

CNC Tattoo, the flagship brand of Solong Co., Ltd. and headquartered in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China, is one of the fastest-growing and most respected professional tattoo equipment brands in the world. Founded in 2018 with a clear mission — to honour the history, culture, and craft of tattooing by providing the very best tools and the highest level of service to artists who carry on the tradition — CNC has grown from a startup into a globally trusted brand in just a few years, with registered trademarks and product patents held in the United States, Europe, and other major markets worldwide.

Built on over 15 years of combined manufacturing experience within the Solong group, CNC Tattoo is driven by a 200+ member engineering and R&D team that develops every product with real artist feedback at its core — not guesswork. The result is a comprehensive professional lineup spanning wireless tattoo pen machines, cartridge needles, inks, power supplies, stencil printers, armrests, and complete tattoo kits — all certified to the highest international safety and quality standards including FDA, CE, FCC, MSDS, TUV, and EO Sterilized certification. With over 2,000 distributors across global markets, products shipped worldwide with full tracking, and a 24/7 customer support team that resolves the vast majority of issues within hours, CNC Tattoo has earned its reputation as the go-to professional supply source for tattoo artists at every level — from studio beginners to internationally recognised professionals.
